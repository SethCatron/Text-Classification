# Text-Classification
The project involves creating a TfidfVectorizer using spam and ham files, analyzing the top 25 words in one spam and ham message using a pandas DataFrame, training a RandomForestClassifier on parts 1-9 spam and kitchen-l ham emails, predicting the emails in GP parts 10-12 and lokay-m using the trained classifier, and analyzing the accuracy of the classifier. The process is repeated using a stopwords list containing "enron" and HTML tags.
